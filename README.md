# Lambda Starship

Lambda Starship (stylized as (lambda () starship)) is a video game that aims to
teach players Lisp and functional programming patterns.

Take a look at the [paper][thesis].

This repository contains the Unity project for Lambda Starship, which may be
imported and built in Unity 2017 and perhaps later.

Builds are available [here][builds] for MacOS, Windows, and Linux.
